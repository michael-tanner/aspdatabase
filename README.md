Updated Nov 8, 2024

ASPdatabase.NET is now open source.




[Michael Tanner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdtanner/) originally built ASPdatabase.net in 2002 and then redeveloped it with modern C# and published in 2014.

This repo contains the latest code for version 2.0

C# and JavaScript are the primary languages, and a tool called [SharpKit](https://github.com/SharpKit/SharpKit) was extensively used as a compiler from C# to JavaScript for all web UI components. SharpKit, in its time, was an excellent tool for writing strongly typed code for translation into web-based JavaScript. It was similar to [Google Web Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit), which compiled Java into JavaScript. Today's modern web developers primarily use tools such as Angular, Vue, or React to accomplish much of what SharpKit enabled for ASPdatabase.net. Using this approach, all compiled JavaScript in this product was in a single file and therefore served as a Single-page App  (SPA) before SPAs were commonplace.
